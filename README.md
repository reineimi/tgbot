# Files
> Note: Every file must be stored in either the same directory as `tgbot.js`, or your local GitHub repository. The only exception is `conf.json`, which cannot be stored on GitHub.

## conf.json
Will be generated from `install.sh` or created manually. Contains:
```json
{
  "bot_token": "here",
  "github": "user/repo",
  "commandsMenu": false,
  "keywordsMenu": true
}
```
From which:
- `bot_token` Your token generated by [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)

- `github` Your GitHub username and repository, taken from:<br>
**https:// github.com /`user` /`repo`**

- `commandsMenu` A button with commands list in the chat

- `keywordsMenu` A list of buttons beneath the chat

#
## commands.json
A list of commands with the following syntax:
```json
{
  "command": "description",
  "test": "A test"
}
```
> Note: Commands are `/command` actions with associated text documents.

Once you've added a command, create the corresponding `.md` document file in the same directory:<br>
`command.md` (example: `test.md`).

#
## keywords.json
A list of keywords (phrases) with the following syntax:
```json
{
  "keyword": "filename.extension",
  "A test": "example.jpg"
}
```
> Note: Keywords are buttons/phrases with associated images.

Same as with commands, we create corresponding files (ex: `example.jpg`) for every keyword.
